The system aims to profit from arbitraging the peso/dolar futures market. By exploring combinations of the spread of different peso/dolar contracts, we can profit from a contraction on that spread. 

## Theoretical Spread and Cost of Carry  
The spread between a near-term contract (e.g., May) and a far-term contract (e.g., August) should reflect the cost of carry. If interest rates or other factors suggest the spread should be a certain value, but the actual market spread is different, this mispricing creates an opportunity.  

## Example  
Suppose the May contract is priced at 100 ARS/USD and the August contract at 105 ARS/USD, making the spread 5 ARS/USD. If the cost of carry suggests the spread should be only 3 ARS/USD, a trader could sell the May contract and buy the August contract. As the spread narrows to 3 ARS/USD, the trader profits from the difference.
